# Analysis of Adverse Drug Effects Using Big Data

This project analyzes Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) using big data and machine learning. The data is sourced from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).

## 📊 Objectives
- Detect patterns in drug side effects
- Predict serious adverse outcomes
- Evaluate models (Random Forest, MLP, FLAML, GridSearch)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Apache Spark
- scikit-learn, FLAML
- Google Cloud Storage
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 🧾 Files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks
- `scripts/`: Data download logic
- `data/`: Dataset list
- `results/`: Comparison of FLAML and Grid Search
- `docs/`: Project report (PDF)
